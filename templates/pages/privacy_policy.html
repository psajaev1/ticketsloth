<p><strong>When Ticketsloth Discloses Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Third Parties/Advertisers and Your Information</strong></p>

Specifically, Ticketsloth may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email about or for Ticketsloth, to remove repetitive information from our User lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where the Service utilizes third parties for the processing of any personal information, Ticketsloth will implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Ticketsloth specified purposes.</p>

<p><strong>User Options and Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>User profiles contain information about individual Users that those Users may want to share with other Users. Protecting the privacy of your profile is each individual User&#39;s responsibility. Ticketsloth cautions you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver&#39;s license numbers) with other Users or place such information in a User profile.</p>

<p>Any information a User chooses to display on his/her Ticketsloth User profile will be viewable by the entire World Wide Web. For every User&#39;s safety, Ticketsloth cautions all Users not to include home addresses, telephone numbers or any other personal information that could allow strangers to contact a User outside of the Ticketsloth service.</p>

<p>To maintain privacy, it is also important not to share a User password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols helps to make guessing a User password more difficult. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.</p>

<p>It is each User&#39;s individual responsibility to select the desired privacy setting upon creation of an account or registering with the Ticketsloth Service. Upon registering with the Ticketsloth service, some privacy settings items may have a default privacy setting so that a degree of privacy protection is selected. In this case, it is the User&#39;s responsibility to understand the associated privacy setting before creating content to ensure the handling of a User&#39;s information meets their individual expectations.</p>

<p>A User may choose to correct or update the information they have submitted to Ticketsloth by editing their User profile or account information. If a User removes your information, it may continue to persist on back-up media.</p>
